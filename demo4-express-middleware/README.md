In this exercise we want to build up middleware components.

1. Write a simple middle component that logs information for each request.
2. Put the middleware component in a separate module and reference it.

# Node modules

* Node modules do not pollute global space.
* Node mudles can be a single file or a folder. If it's a folder then index.js is the default file it loads, can be overwritten by package.json.
